# Feigenbaum


Shows different execution parameters of 

```
p (t) = p (t-1) + p (t-1) * k * (1 - p(t-1))
```
## Language
Writtein in Processing without IDE
Why?
- Easy to implement graphics
- I already implemented a similar simulation earlier, so I wanted to quickly see results
- Good to finally get back into processing
- I like VIM too much to use the IDE

## Examples
